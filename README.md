# Rubik-Prototype-Unity
 
Rubik's cube simulation made with Unity

You can test it at: https://diegogm27.github.io/Rubik-Web/

Note: It's not a finished product, I'm still working on it and planning to make it look better and add more features like higher order cubes, animations, music and sounds, etc.
